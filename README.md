# CS-305-T4196-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, is a financial institute wanting to implement efficient security to their existing application.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I'm not sure of anything inparticular to note in regards to what I did well. Secure coding is important as it could lead to users' sensitive information at risk for being stolen. Checking for known vulnerabilities through the dependency check is a great way to circumvent potential security issues. Ensuring your users' information is safe and secure creates trust within the user base as well as maintaining users knowing they can trust you with their data. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The dependency check was very helpful but also gave me a little bit of trouble. For whatever reason, the dependency check wouldn't pop up in the file structure within Eclipse; I had to navigate to it through my computers file explorer. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I noticed several of the dependencies and libraries were old iterations. In the future, I would make sure the most recent stable builds are used. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

While coding, I ran debugs to ensure my code was operating properly. Once the application was complete, I ran a final vulnerability check to make sure I didn't introduce any new issues. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Stack overflow, and google searches in general, were a huge help when I ran into problems I couldn't solve on my own or through the supplied material. It allowed me to see the solution as well as explanations as to why it's done a certain way. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show my ability to implement a hash function to encrypt communication.
